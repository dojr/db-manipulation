# db-manipulation
A repo containing the manipulation of brewery and beer data.

There are two files in the root of the repo which contain the original data and the final version of that data which is cleaned up.

The files contained in brewery_csv_backups are exactly that. I made small changes to the data over time and accumulated different versions that would help me in case something went wrong.

The compare_brew folder contains database manipulation in getting beers from another brewery db to my original brewery db. That is, I made the id's in the beer data match my own brew_id's.

The python_files folder contains very unorganized sequence of python files in which I manipulated the 18 or so brewery csv files I created.
